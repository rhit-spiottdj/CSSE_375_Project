# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
The team shows steady progress. Good job!

## Suggested next action items :fist:
Nothing particular -- keep doing what your team has been doing!

## Highlight of your team's work :partying_face:
1. The commit history shows a great flow of BVA and TDD. Good job!
2. Every team member seems to have a reasonable chunk of job assigned. Good teamwork!

## Improvements to consider :star:
1. For each task in the project domain, briefly describe what the task is, what public methods are under development, what other classes this class interacts with and etc.
2. I can be wrong but I don't see domain randomization planned to be done, but it is part of Starting Set-up For Experienced Players.
