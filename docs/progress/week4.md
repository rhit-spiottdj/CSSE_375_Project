# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
GUI implementation has begun. Great! However, I can be wrong but I don't see any substantial development on the core logic. Make sure to understand the grading rubrics and the requirement for steady progress.

## Suggested next action items :fist:
1)  Plan accordingly to make up the missing work from Week 4. 
2)  Keep using the Projects Board to plan and track progress

## Highlight of your team's work :partying_face:
Linters are added and GUI dev has begun! 

## Improvements to consider :star:
N/A
